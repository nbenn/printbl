# printbl

Pretty printing for any 2D datastructure in R that provides an implementation of the following generic methods

* `base::head()`/`base::tail()`
* `base::nrow()`

and optionally

* `base::rownames()`
* `printbl::obj_desc()`

## Installation

You can install the released version of printbl from [github](https://github.com/nbenn/printbl) with:

## Example

For example a `data.frame` which has row names:

```{r example}

```
